Information about libsambox-java
--------------------------------

This package was debianized using the mh_make command
from the maven-debian-helper package.

The build system uses Maven but prevents it from downloading
anything from the Internet, making the build compliant with
the Debian policy.

The complete src/test directory was removed because we already ship the same
files in libpdfbox2-java and we also don't run the tests.
